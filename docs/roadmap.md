Define Models and Database Context:

In Roanna.Core, define your domain models. These should include entities like Article, User, Payment, APCPolicy, etc.
In Roanna.Infrastructure, set up your Entity Framework Core context and define DbSet properties for your models.
Repository and Unit of Work Patterns:

Implement repository patterns in Roanna.Infrastructure for abstracting data access logic.
Consider adding a Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions.
Service Layer Development:

Develop services in Roanna.Core for business logic. This may include services for user management, APC calculation, policy enforcement, etc.
Ensure services are interfaced to promote loose coupling and easier testing.
API Controllers and Endpoints:

In Roanna.Web, create API controllers. These controllers will use services from Roanna.Core to handle HTTP requests.
Define routes that align with RESTful principles and ensure they are well-documented, perhaps using Swagger.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication and authorization in Roanna.Web. Look into ASP.NET Identity for a robust solution.
Secure your APIs, possibly using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.
Common Utilities and Helpers:

Populate Roanna.Common with utilities and helpers like custom exception handlers, logging mechanisms, configuration helpers, etc.
Front-End Development (if applicable):

If your application includes a front-end, start building it in the Views and wwwroot directories of Roanna.Web.
Testing:

Develop unit tests in Roanna.Core.Tests, Roanna.Infrastructure.Tests, and Roanna.Web.Tests.
Focus on testing critical business logic, data access layers, and API endpoints.
Database Migrations:

Manage database changes using EF Core Migrations in Roanna.Infrastructure.
API Documentation:

Document your API endpoints, possibly using tools like Swagger for API documentation and testing.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging and monitoring to track the application's health and performance.
Cloud Integration and Deployment:

If you're planning to deploy to the cloud, configure cloud services (e.g., Azure, AWS) and integrate as necessary.
Security Compliance:

Review and ensure your application complies with relevant security standards, especially if handling sensitive user data.
Review and Refinement:

Continuously review your code, architecture, and practices. Refine and refactor as needed.
Plan for Future Developments:

Consider features for future releases, like advanced analytics, AI integration, etc.
Remember, the development of such a platform is iterative. Start with creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and enhance it over time based on user feedback and new requirements.

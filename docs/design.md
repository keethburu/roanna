A a flexible, scalable, and secure platform for APC and OA management. The emphasis is on leveraging existing technologies and cloud services to avoid reinventing the wheel and facilitate rapid development and deployment. 

# Core Feature Set
## APC Management
Automated handling of APCs, including invoicing, payment tracking, and reconciliation.
## Metadata Capture and Integration
Ability to integrate with peer review and production systems to capture necessary metadata.
## User Identification and Authentication
Integration with 3rd party auth providers like ORCID, Google, etc., for user verification and tracking.
## Integration in Public Research Information Infrastructure
### Support PIDs
GRID, ROR, Ringgold, FundRef, ISNI
### Information Exchange
OA-Switchboard, Crossref, DataCite ect
## Publisher-Specific Business Rules
Customizable rules for discounts, waivers, and tiered pricing.
## Institutional Account Management
Features to manage institutional accounts, including credits, debits, tokens, and promo codes. Integratin with OA Switchboard
## Multi-Currency and Tax Handling
Capabilities to handle multiple currencies and automate tax calculations. (Based on integrated 3rd party services)
## Payment Processing
Integration with PCI-compliant payment gateways to support various payment methods.
Reporting and Analytics: Customizable reporting tools for publishers, authors, and institutions/funders.

# App Domain Model Entities
## Author/User
Represents individuals submitting articles, with properties for identification and authentication.
## Publisher
Entities that manage journals and handle APCs.
## Institution/Funder
Entities responsible for funding authors or managing institutional accounts.
## Article
Represents submitted articles, including metadata related to peer review and publication.
## Transaction
Captures details of APC payments, including amounts, currency, and payment method.

# Core MVP Features (Version 0.1.0)
The MVP should serve as a proof of concept that demonstrates the platform's potential value in simplifying and automating the APC and OA management process. Itâ€™s important to balance simplicity with functionality, ensuring that the MVP addresses the core pain points of the target user base while leaving room for future enhancements based on user feedback and technological advancements.

## Basic APC Management
Enable automated handling of APCs with basic features for invoicing and payment tracking.
Limit to the most common payment methods initially, such as credit card and wire transfer.

## Metadata Capture and Integration
Integrate with a limited number of peer review and production systems to capture essential metadata.
Prioritize integration with widely-used systems or those that offer the simplest integration paths.
